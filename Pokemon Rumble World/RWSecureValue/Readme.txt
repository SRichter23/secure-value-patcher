Rumble World Secure Value Updater by suloku 2015
************************************************

Included files:
_______________
 - src.zip: source code of RWSecureValue.exe
 - Rumblecheker.zip: simple application that can check the integrity of the Pokemon Rumble World save files, see included readme.

How to use:
___________

1.- Copy your old 00slot00 folder to the "old" folder.
2.- Copy the latest working backup 00slot00 folder to the "new" folder.
3.- Run the program, the secure value from the new save will be inserted in the old save.
4.- Restore your savegame

VERY IMPORTANT: if you play rumble world after making the latest working backup and before restoring the updated old savefile, the secure value will change and this won't work, because it needs the LATEST  rumble world savegame in your 3ds, and the first thing Rumble World does is save the file, so if you boot the game it will no longuer be the latest savefile.
